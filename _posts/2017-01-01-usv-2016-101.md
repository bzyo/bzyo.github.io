## Walkthrough 
Initial nmap shows ssh on 22, web on 80, proxy on 3129, mysql on 3306, and ftp on 21211

<br><br>

Looking at ssh first and it revealed an ascii dragon and what looks like a hash or encrypted string.

<br><br>

Looking closer, the dragon has AES-ECB written near the top so a quick Google search finds a decoder aesencryption.net. Took a stab at the key being xxxxx0000000xxxxxx that is also shown in the dragon.

Result was flag1

Knowing no credentials for ssh, I browse the website for clues but immediately got access forbidden

<br><br>

Running dirb against gave the same error
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-dirbfail.png)
<br><br>

Stuck, I remembered that a squid proxy was revealed during the nmap. 
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-squid.png)
<br><br>

As always, I run everything through burp suite so I added the proxy setting as an upstream proxy
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-upstreamproxy.png)
<br><br>

The proxy setting did the trick and the website reveals a single page with a changing banner of "WINTER IS COMING" and "ALL MEN MUST DIE". Great...Game of Thrones, a show I know nothing about :(
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-80allowed.png)
<br><br>

The site didn't show much of anything else so I run it through dirb again with the proxy settings. It reveals a WordPress site at /blog

<br><br>

Game of Thrones notion confirmed as The Seven Kingdoms blog is revealed
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-wordpress.png)
<br><br>

Since it's WordPress I run the site through wpscan and it reveals a base64 encoded string for an X-XSS Protection header

Nothing else is revealed in wpscan so going back to the site reveals an interesting second post with a title of "I have a message for you!"
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-hodor001.png)
<br><br>

There is nothing else to the post so looking at the image location reveals a much different path than the normal WordPress directory of wp-content/uploads
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-hodor002.png)
<br><br>

Moving up one level reveals the message and a download link which turns out to be a zip file

<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-hodor004.png)

Unzipping the file reveals an image file named hodor and the picture shows an base64 encoded string

Back to the site there are several long winded irrelevant posts in a row and then an interesting last one titled "Protected: The secret Chapter"
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-secretchapter.png)
<br><br>

*This one took some time and to spare your time I won't go through my failures

Looking back at all the several long winded irrelevant posts, I decided to create a word list file out of them by using cewl
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-cewl.png)
<br><br>

Running the new word list through burp intruder also failed
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-burp001.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-burp002.png)
<br><br>


With that I decided to look into how the password was being passed after submitting. Turns out it does a post and then a get with the addition of a cookie that encodes the password
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-post.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-get.png)
<br><br>

With that information I setup burp intruder to include redirection and cookies
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-burp003.png)
<br><br>

Left the scan running overnight as it's a long process, but it finally revealed the keyword of Westerosi, a base64 encoded string and a new clue of "The mother_of_dragons has a password which is in front of your eyes"
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-burpsecret.png)

Decoding the string reveals flag4

Tested the password on the actual post and it reveals a picture
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-secretexposed.png)
<br><br>

Knowing nothing of Game of Thrones I resorted to Google to see if there were any clues about Daenerys Targaryen's eyes. Apparently the actress is known for her eyebrows so I tested every combination of eyebrow and brow that I could think of. No luck.

Stumped I looked at the clue again.  The clue states "has a password which is in front of your eyes"...wait...it can't be that easy. Could the password be "in front of your eyes"? Nope.

Then I remember there are other services ssh, mysql and ftp.  Testing ssh fails and mysql shows that no remote connections allowed. However ftp works and reveals two text files, readme.txt and .note.txt
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-ftp.png)
<br><br>

The readme.txt file hints to look for a hidden file (already done) and the .note.txt file states that mother_of_dragons WordPress password are her children's name
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-ftpnote.png)
<br><br>

Back to Google and I find that Daenerys Targaryen has no children, but three dragons with the names of Rhaegal, Drogon and Viserion. So I put those names into a file along with various combination of all names combined
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-children.png)
<br><br>

Running the list through wpscan reveals RhaegalDrogonViserion as the password

Now to test those credentials on the site...

<br><br>

and we're in!
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-wpadmin.png)
<br><br>

Looking around the site I found the profile section which reveals a base64 encoded string for mother_of_dragons
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-wpprofile.png)
<br><br>

Decoding the string reveals flag5

With only two flags left I figured it was time for shell access. As an admin of the site I'm able to edit the theme, so I replace the footer.php page with a php reverse shell from pentestmonkey and setup my listener
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-wpfooter.png)
<br><br>

Boom!...limited shell as user http
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-limitedshell.png)
<br><br>

Lookin at the passwd file, it shows the home directory for http at /srv/http
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-passwd.png)
<br><br>

Changing to /srv/http directory reveals the website files and directory, an interesting file named 'winterfell_messenger' that we'll come back to, and a text file named 'reward_flag.txt'. Reading the reward file reveals a base64 encoded string

Decoding the string reveals flag6

*Again, this one took some time and to spare your time I won't go through my failures

Back to the interesting file winterfell_messenger, we see it's executable, SUID is set and the owner is root. Running the program shows that it's using cat to read a file in the /root directory
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-exec.png)
<br><br>

Using strings it's revealed that cat is being used, however it's not using the full path to the program. From this we know that it will search the set PATH to run.
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-strings.png)
<br><br>

Now we're able to update PATH by using export, but first we need to find a writable directory and per usual we'll use /tmp
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-writeable.png)
<br><br>
*snippet of output

Using export I add /tmp to be checked first
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-export.png)
<br><br>

Now we need to create a executable file in /tmp named cat so it can be called by the winterfell_messenger program. Seeing that this file will be run as root, why not call a shell using /bin/sh
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-tmpcat.png)
<br><br>

And now running the winterfell_messenger program...root
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-root.png)
<br><br>

Viewing the /root directory reveals .flag.txt file
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-rootdir.png)
<br><br>
Before showing the contents of the file, the PATH needs to be updated to remove the /tmp directory we added
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-exportupdate.png)
<br><br>

Now running cat against the .flag.txt file we get a congratulations, a cute ascii wolf, and a base64 encoded string
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/USV_2016-v101/imgs/usv-cat.png)
<br><br>

Decoding the string reveals flag7
