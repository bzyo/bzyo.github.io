## Walkthrough
**nmap**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/nmap.png)
<br><br>
**default 80**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/default80.png)
<br><br>
**flag 1 found in source**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag1.png)
<br><br>
**flag 1 decoded gives hint to look at all the files**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag1decoded.png)
<br><br>
**looking further at source the js files look like base64**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/jsfiles.png)
<br><br>
**putting together and decoding gives flag 2 and next hint looks like a directory**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag2.png)
<br><br>
**hint from flag 2 gives login page**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/imfadmin.png)
<br><br>
**source hints to sqli...yeah i wasn't able to get it**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/imfadmin_source.png)
<br><br>
**went to gobuster and dirb after failing at sqli**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/gobuster.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/dirb.png)
<br><br>
**image found contains qr code**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/whiteboard.png)
<br><br>
**flag 4 found and gives php upload file name**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag4.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag4decoded.png)
<br><br>
**using found uploader, a test upload of jpg is successful**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/uploadr942.png)
<br><br>
**we know from gobuster of uploads/image directories but file isn't there**<br>
**looking at source after upload there is a hash commented out**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/uploadhash.png)
<br><br>
**hash plus file ext we find our uploaded image**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/uploadtest.png)
<br><br>
**trying to upload a php file fails**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/nophp.png)
<br><br>
**adding .jpg to .php file fails due to signature checks**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/extadd.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/crappywaf.png)
<br><br>
**also find there are file size restrictions, but gifs work**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/sizerestrict.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/gifs.png)
<br><br>
**after much searching it came to a combination of things to overcome the upload restrictions**<br>
**file restrictions using GIF89a; as found in this [post](https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/bypass_image_upload.html) worked**<br>
**after so many php oneliner restrictions, using backticks as shown [here](http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.execution.php) worked**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/cmdgif.png)
<br><br>
**uploading and calling the above gif/code gives code execution**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/rce.png)
<br><br>
**modifying code, uploading and calling again gives flag 5**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag5.png)
<br><br>
**next hint seems like something running on the system so we need a shell**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag5decoded.png)
<br><br>
**since flag 3 was missed, we modify our code to look at file listings and cat out the index.php**<br>
**whatever lolz**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/filelists.png)<br>
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag3.png)<br>
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag3decoded.png)
<br><br>
**now for reverse shell, we know there are a bunch of restrictions around php oneliners**<br>
**so maybe [python](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)? initial call didn't work so we look at an all file list**<br>
**specifically under /usr/bin and we find python3**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/python3.png)
<br><br>
**this is our code to get a shell**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/python3revshell.png)
<br><br>
**finally, but we're just getting started**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/revshell.png)
<br><br>
**from hint we look at /etc/services and find it's running on 7788/tcp**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/agentservice.png)
<br><br>
**also did find for agent**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/agentsearch.png)
<br><br>
**running agent looks to be what were looking for**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/agentlocation.png)
<br><br>
**directory contains two files**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/usrlocalbin.png)
<br><br>
**we know the binary asks for an ID and using strings we see a string compare**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/strings.png)
<br><br>
**forgot we were on a remote system and started examining file...ltrace was installed and code found :)**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/ltrace.png)
<br><br>
**code works and im assuming a buffer overflow**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/agentid.png)
<br><br>
**after some time we find option 3, submit report is vulnerable**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/bof.png)
<br><br>
**so now what? remembered that this isn't only a binary, but it's running on port 7788**<br>
**only port 80 is open though**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/nc.png)
<br><br>
**insert lots of wasted time x1000**<br><br>
**finally noticed that knockd is running and remembered the access_codes file**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/knockd.png)
<br><br>
**i know of port knocking, but not very familiar...off to google**<br><br>
**found good digital ocean [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-port-knocking-to-hide-your-ssh-daemon-from-attackers-on-ubuntu) of what i needed todo**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/digoce.png)
<br><br>
**followed instructions and modified a bit**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/portknock.png)
<br><br>
**and it worked**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/nc7788.png)
<br><br>
**so now we have to work on the exploit on our local machine**<br>
**simple copy over to the web directory and a wget**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/cpagent.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/wget.png)
<br><br>
**now onto the binary**<br><br>
**start by creating pattern of 200**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/pattern.png)
<br><br>
**examined in gdb**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/gdb01.png)
<br><br>
**find the offset of 168**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/offset.png)
<br><br>
**then test offset in gdb and it's correct**<br>
**also find that the overflow is in eax so we find our jmp or call rather to this register**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/calleax.png)
<br><br>
**started to play around with [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) lately and created a skeleton exploit script**<br>
**referenced the [documentation](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) and this [post](https://0xdeadbeefjerky.github.io/2017/09/23/csaw-ctf-pilot-writeup.html) heavily**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/skel.png)
<br><br>
**test out the skeleton code, seems to work**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/testskel.png)
<br><br>
**we know we need a reverse shell so we create using msfvenom**<br>
**after some back and forth i find \x0a is also bad char**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/msfvenom.png)
<br><br>
**update the payload of our script**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/payloadupdate.png)
<br><br>
**do an initial test and it works; so we remove the interactive stance from our script**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/skeltest1.png)
<br><br>
**we then setup a local listener and test again...BOOM**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/skeltest2.png)
<br><br>
**with that working we run script against remote system and we have a reverse shell as root**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/rootrevshell.png)
<br><br>
**flag 6 found and decoded**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag6.png)
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/2016/IMF_1/imgs/flag6decoded.png)
<br><br>
**the end**
