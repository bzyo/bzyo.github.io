**nmap**

<br><br>

**default 80, seems like we need to login as admin :)**

<br><br>

**dirb doesn't reveal much**

<br><br>

**decide to specify file type and some more results show up**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/dirb2.png)
<br><br>

**checking command.php in repeater with a post method, we see we can list files.  however we need to be logged in to do so.**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/command.png)
<br><br>

**insert a lot of time wasted on wfuzz, sql injections, gobuster, hydra, nmap, and more enumeration.  started some googling and didn't know you could use hydra to post to http forms. this [post](https://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2013/04/17/http-form-password-brute-forcing-the-need-for-speed.html) helped.**<br><br>

**lots of trial and error for the hydra commands/options, but found one that finally worked**

<br><br>

**login works and we tryout the command to list files**

<br><br>

**checking request in burp repeater we see where we need to update**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/burpcommand.png)
<br><br>

**with that /etc/passwd is readable and several usernames are found**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/etcpasswd.png)
<br><br>

**checking all users home directories there is a backup passwords file**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/lshome.png)
<br><br>

**seems like the list can be used as a password list, so we build one**

<br><br>

**hydra used with jim, password is found and ssh is successful**

<br><br>

**find a suid bash script, but it's nothing.  mail file isn't much, however...**

<br><br>

**/var/mail holds a message with password for charles**
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/jimmail.png)
<br><br>

**su as charles and we can sudo program teehee with no password.  assumption teehee is really just tee, some testing **
<br>![alt text](../vulnhub/DC-4/sucharles.png)
<br><br>

**some googling and seems tee can be used to within vi, so we add charles to the sudo group using vi and sudo teehee.  good post on it [here](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-tee-command/)**<br><br>

**checking the change it worked and logging out and back in as charles we see he's part of sudo**

**quick sudo gives root flag**
